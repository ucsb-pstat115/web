# Winter 2022: PSTAT 115: Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis

In this course, we will explore the data science lifecycle: question formulation, data collection & cleaning, exploratory data analysis & visualization, statistical inference and prediction, and decision-making.


**Instructor:** Professor Alexander Franks

**Prerequisites:** PSTAT 120B, PSTAT 126

**Catalog description:** An introduction to the Bayesian approach to statistical inference, its theoretical foundations and comparison to classical methods. Topics include parameter estimation, testing, prediction and computational methods (Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation). Emphasis on concepts, methods and data analysis. Extensive use of the R programming language and examples from the social, biological and physical sciences to illustrate concepts.

**Programming experience:** Intermediate familiarity with R and Rmarkdown is
required.

Learning by doing will require software documentation, experimenting by trial-and-error, and lots of debugging. 
We are looking for self-motivated students with diverse interests in data science.
